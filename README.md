# student-portal-salesforce-integration
Student portal with two-way Salesforce sync to replace manual ETL from Qualtrics. Enables students to manage profiles, submit applications, and update info. Improves data accuracy, reduces admin workload, and avoids paid third-party tools.

## ðŸš© Problem Statement
We currently collect student applications for all PTTL programs through Qualtrics and I manually ETL the data into Salesforce. This process is not automated, makes duplicate detection difficult (especially when students use different emails), and is time-consuming. We are seeking developer support to build a more efficient, automated solution.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals
- Replace manual ETL with automated data sync
- Enable students to manage their own profiles and applications
- Improve data accuracy and reduce administrative workload

## ðŸ’¡ Proposed Features
- Student login portal
- Profile and application management
- Two-way sync with Salesforce
- Duplicate detection logic
- Admin dashboard

## ðŸš« Constraints
- No paid third-party tools or apps
